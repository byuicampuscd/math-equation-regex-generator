# Math Equation Regex Generator

##Purpose
This is an intermediary LMS transition solution for the departments that use math on BYU-Idaho.  In I-Learn 2.0 (Brainhoney LMS), variables and ranges are supported in the math questions.  I-Learn 3.0 (Brightspace LMS) does not support that.  So this solution is to generate question libraries as fast as possible that would in essence also address the lack of variables in I-Learn 3.0

##Use
Copy and paste a CSV file into the first text box.
