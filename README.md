# Math Equation Regex Generator

##Purpose
This is an intermediary LMS transition solution for the departments that use math on BYU-Idaho.  In I-Learn 2.0 (Brainhoney LMS), question variables and ranges are supported in the math questions.  I-Learn 3.0 (Brightspace LMS) does not support variables.  So this web application solution is to generate question libraries as fast as possible.  That would in essence also address the lack of question variables in I-Learn 3.0
